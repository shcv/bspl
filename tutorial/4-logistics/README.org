* Exercise 4: Multi-Party Logistics Protocol
In this exercise, you'll implement a complex multi-party protocol for a logistics operation.
This protocol involves four different roles that need to coordinate to fulfill orders.
This exercise will demonstrate the power of forms-based programming for managing complex correlation logic.

** Learning Objectives
- Implement a multi-party protocol with four distinct roles
- Master complex correlation patterns with the forms-based approach

** The Logistics Protocol
#+begin_example
Logistics {
  roles Merchant, Wrapper, Labeler, Packer
  parameters out orderID key, out itemID key, out item, out status
  private address, label, wrapping

  Merchant -> Labeler: RequestLabel[out orderID key, out address]
  Merchant -> Wrapper: RequestWrapping[in orderID key, out itemID key, out item]
  Wrapper -> Packer: Wrapped[in orderID key, in itemID key, in item, out wrapping]
  Labeler -> Packer: Labeled[in orderID key, in address, out label]
  Packer -> Merchant: Packed[in orderID key, in itemID key, in wrapping, in label, out status]
}
#+end_example

This protocol models a logistics operation where:
  1. A Merchant creates an order and requests shipping labels and item wrapping
  2. The Labeler generates shipping labels for the order
  3. The Wrapper wraps individual items within the order
  4. The Packer combines wrapped items with shipping labels to finalize packages
  5. The Merchant receives confirmation when items are packed

** Tasks
*** Complete the Configuration
Create a =logistics_config.py= file to set up the protocol and define roles and agent addresses.
*** Implement the Merchant
Create a =merchant.py= file to implement the Merchant agent that:
  - Initiates orders with unique orderIDs
  - Requests labels with shipping addresses
  - Requests wrapping for multiple items per order
  - Handles packed confirmations
*** Implement the Labeler
Create a =labeler.py= file to implement the Labeler agent that:
  - Receives label requests
  - Generates appropriate shipping labels
  - Sends labels to the Packer
*** Implement the Wrapper
Create a =wrapper.py= file to implement the Wrapper agent that:
  - Receives wrapping requests
  - Selects appropriate wrapping material based on item type
  - Sends wrapped items to the Packer
*** Implement the Packer
Create a =packer.py= file to implement the Packer agent that:
  - Receives wrapped items and shipping labels
  - Matches labels with the correct wrapped items
  - Confirms packing status to the Merchant
*** Create a Start Script
Create a =start.sh= script to run all four agents.

** Implementation Guidelines
You should primarily use the forms-based (=@adapter.enabled()=) approach to implement all four agents, as this will dramatically simplify the complex correlation logic required, especially for the Packer.

** Expected Output
When running all agents, you should see:
  1. Merchant creating orders with multiple items
  2. Labeler generating labels
  3. Wrapper wrapping items
  4. Packer combining labels with wrapped items
  5. Merchant receiving packed confirmations

Check the =solution= directory for hints, or to compare your final result.

** Testing Your Solution
A test script is provided to automatically test your implementation:

#+begin_example
./test.sh
#+end_example

This script will:
- Run your implementation
- Collect logs in the =logs/= directory
- Verify that all four agents are correctly participating in the protocol
- Confirm that orders progress through all stages of the logistics process
- Check that items are successfully being packed and orders completed
- Report on successful and failed test cases

You can also use the solution test script as a reference or to test specific components:

#+begin_example
# Run only the solution implementation
solution/test.sh

# Test your merchant.py with solution support agents
solution/test.sh merchant.py

# Test your merchant.py and wrapper.py with other solution agents
solution/test.sh merchant.py wrapper.py

# Test all your components together
solution/test.sh merchant.py labeler.py wrapper.py packer.py
#+end_example

This approach lets you test individual components against known working implementations, which is especially helpful for isolating issues in a multi-agent system.

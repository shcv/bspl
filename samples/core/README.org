* Core Protocol Patterns

This directory contains fundamental BSPL protocol patterns that demonstrate core concepts.

** Protocols

*** basic.bspl
Minimal protocol demonstrating basic message exchange.
- Status: Safe and live
- Key concepts: Simple parameter flow, key bindings

*** create-order.bspl
Order creation and management protocol.
- Status: Safe and live
- Key concepts: Order lifecycle, parameter initialization

** Note

Most purchase, sale, and e-business protocols have been moved to the =trade-finance/= directory as they represent domain-specific implementations rather than core patterns.

** Usage Examples

Verify a basic protocol:
#+begin_src bash
bspl verify core/basic.bspl
#+end_src

For purchase/sale examples, see:
#+begin_src bash
ls ../trade-finance/purchase*.bspl
#+end_src

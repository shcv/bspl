* BSPL
BSPL stands for the Blindingly Simple Protocol Language.

This repository provides tools for working with the language, including a parser and verification tools (proving safety, liveness, etc.)
It also provides a library for implementing agents that can enact BSPL protocols.

** Installation
BSPL may eventually be made available through the PyPI package registry, but for now install it directly from github.

*** Prerequisites
BSPL requires python version 3.4 or later.
On Windows, Python 3.6+ is recommended.

*** Install from source (Gitlab)
1. Download the source code from gitlab:
  #+begin_example
  $ git clone https://gitlab.com/masr/bspl.git
  #+end_example
2. Optionally create virtual environment for BSPL
  #+begin_example
  $ python -m venv venv
  #+end_example
3. Activate virtual environment (do this whenever you start a new shell session)
  - Linux:
    #+begin_example
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    #+end_example
  - Windows:
    #+begin_example
    $ venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    #+end_example
3. Install package in development mode
  #+begin_example
  $ python setup.py develop
  #+end_example


** Usage
   When installed globally, BSPL provides the 'bspl' entrypoint, that can be used as follows:

   #+begin_example

   #+end_example

   The CLI is implemented using the Fire library, which means that each command supports the "-h" help option to list the possible arguments.
   Grouped commands, such as those under ~sat~, may inherit arguments from their parent, so check both.

   Fire enables inspection and chaining of function results, such as with the ~load-file~ command for loading a specification.
   After the specification is loaded, you can inspect its contents and call methods on them, etc.

   Fire can also launch a python shell with various objects available via ~--interactive~.
   For example, try ~bspl load-file samples/bspl/purchase protocols Purchase--interactive~, and you should get a python REPL with the Purchase protocol loaded in the ~result~ variable.

   There are some example protocol files in the 'samples' directory.

*** Notes
   - There are probably still some bugs. If you find a case that doesn't work as you expect, please submit an issue.
   - For easier testing of listings used in latex papers, BSPL will automatically strip latex formatting before parsing a protocol, so they should work without modification.

** Implementing Agents
This repository provides a /protocol adapter/ for implementing agents that play roles in a BSPL protocol.

You can run the scenario implementation using the ~start.sh~ script to launch all of the agents at the same time; press any key to kill them and stop the run.

*** Specifying the Protocol
Our tutorial will follow the Logistics scenario, visible in the scenarios directory.

The protocol could be provided as an object in the python code directly, but it is generally easier to specify it as a separate BSPL file and then load it in the agent.
The protocol we will be using is as follows, given in logistics.bspl:
#+begin_src bspl
Logistics {
  roles Merchant, Wrapper, Labeler, Packer
  parameters out orderID key, out itemID key, out item, out status
  private address, label, wrapping, remID, ackID

  Merchant -> Labeler: RequestLabel[out orderID key, out address]
  Merchant -> Wrapper: RequestWrapping[in orderID key, out itemID key, out item]

  Wrapper -> Packer: Wrapped[in orderID key, in itemID key, in item, out wrapping]
  Labeler -> Packer: Labeled[in orderID key, in address, out label]

  Packer -> Merchant: Packed[in orderID key, in itemID key, in item, in wrapping, in label, out status]
}
#+end_src

This protocol describes roles for four agents, each of which are implemented in separate python files.
We will here be focusing on the Merchant, Labeler, and Packer roles.

We need to load the protocol as follows:
#+begin_src python
from bspl import parser
logistics = parser.load_file("logistics.bspl").export("Logistics")
#+end_src

The "export" function converts the bspl protocol into a module, making it easier to access the roles and messages provided.
For example, the merchant could import its role and messages as follows:
#+begin_src python
from Logistics import Merchant, Wrapper, Labeler, Packer
from Logistics import (
    RequestLabel,
    RequestWrapping,
    Packed,
)
#+end_src

*** Configuring the Agent
After loading its protocol, role, and possibly messages, each agent will need to be configured with information about how to connect to the other agents.

In the logistics scenario, all of this is done in a common configuration.py file that can be loaded by all four of the agents, but they could be configured separately.

#+begin_src python
config = {
    Merchant: ("0.0.0.0", 8000),
    Wrapper: ("0.0.0.0", 8001),
    Labeler: ("0.0.0.0", 8002),
    Packer: ("0.0.0.0", 8003),
}
#+end_src

The role binding configuration is a single dictionary mapping roles to tuples containing (IP, port) pairs.
They don't all have to be on the same machine, but in this example we are running them all on localhost (0.0.0.0)
The configuration that each agent sees for itself identifies what IP address and port it should listen on; 0.0.0.0 is chosen here so that they listen on all IPs known to the host networking system.

*** Setting up the adapter
Now we need to create python files for each of the agents, and begin to initialize them.

The main component needed in each agent is its /adapter/, which listens for messages and checks them for compliance to the protocol before handling them.

For the merchant:
#+begin_src python
from bspl.adapter import Adapter
adapter = Adapter(Merchant, Logistics.protocol, config)
#+end_src

The adapter is configured with three parameters: role, protocol, and configuration as declared in the previous section.

*** Running the agent
With an adapter, we have enough to run the agent (though it won't do much yet.)
#+begin_src python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting Merchant...")
    adapter.start()
#+end_src
That's it. Now, if you run merchant.py, it will print "Starting Merchant..." and then just sit there.
Let's make it do something.

*** Acting proactively
To start an enactment of a protocol, some agent will have to make the first move.
In Logistics, that's the Merchant, who requests the wrapping and labeling of the items in an order.
This can be seen from the first message in the protocol, RequestLabel, which has all its parameters labeled ~out~, which means it has no dependencies and can be sent at will.

So, we'll make an order generator that simulates the submission of orders so that the merchant can label them:
#+begin_src python
async def order_generator():
    for orderID in range(10):
        adapter.send(
            RequestLabel(
                orderID=orderID,
                address=random.sample(["Lancaster University", "NCSU"], 1)[0],
            )
        )
        for i in range(2):
            adapter.send(
                RequestWrapping(
                    orderID=orderID,
                    itemID=i,
                    item=random.sample(["ball", "bat", "plate", "glass"], 1)[0],
                )
            )
        await asyncio.sleep(0)
#+end_src

A lot of new things here:
- The function is asynchronous, to work with the adapter
- Messages are constructed by passing in their parameters as keyword arguments
- The resulting message instances are sent with ~adapter.send(message)~
- There's an ~asyncio.sleep(0)~ step near the end to make sure it doesn't all happen instantly, possibly breaking something. Remember to import asyncio

Once we have this order generator, we can tell the agent to run it by including it as a parameter to agent.start:
#+begin_src python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting Merchant...")
    adapter.start(order_generator())
#+end_src

The adapter takes any provided asynchronous tasks, and adds them to its event loop.
This way you can add any number of proactive tasks to your agent.

*** Adding a reactor
In most protocols, not all messages are sent independently like RequestLabel.
Instead, many have dependencies, and may follow a simple request/response pattern.
That's what we see in the Labeler, which sends Label in response to RequestLabel.

The simplest way to handle reactive patterns like this is via a /reactor/, or function registered as a reaction to the reception of a message:

#+begin_src python
@adapter.reaction(RequestLabel)
async def labeled(msg):
    adapter.send(
        Labeled(
            label=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            ,**msg.payload
        )
    )
#+end_src

This snippet from the Labeler agent (labeler.py) declares the labeled function as an asynchronous reaction to the RequestLabel message.
It is passed the received RequestLabel instance as its only parameter, and derives from it the new Labeled message.
Computing the new message is pretty easy, simply bind the out parameters, and copy any in parameters from the previous message.

But some messages require inputs from multiple other messages.
This can be done with reaction handlers, by storing the information until all prerequisites have been received.
However, Bungie also offers another option.

*** Using an enablement handler
The Packer sends the Packed message only once it has received both Wrapped and Labeled, since it needs a label for the order, and wrapping for each item.

The adapter knows from the protocol which information it needs, however, and can invoke a handler when the message becomes /enabled/, called an enablement handler.

#+begin_src python
@adapter.enabled(Packed)
async def pack(msg):
    msg["status"] = "packed"
    return msg
#+end_src

This is source from the Packer agent (packer.py), which shows how simple the enablement handler can be.
Here, the ~pack~ function is registered as a handler for an enabled instance of the Packed message, which is passed in as the only parameter.
The instance is passed in with all of its ~in~ parameters pre-filled from its prerequisites, with only the ~out~ parameters needing to be set in the body.
So, we set status to "packed", and return the message for sending.

Deceptively simple compared to the code it saves for remembering the intermediate values from both the Wrapped and Labeled messages.

"""
This scenario demonstrates implementing BSPL agents using Python decorators.
For an alternative approach using AgentSpeak (ASL), see the grading scenario.
Both approaches are valid and used throughout the project:
- ASL files (like in grading/) are better for complex rule-based behavior
- Python decorators (used here) are simpler for straightforward request-response patterns
